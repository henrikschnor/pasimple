# Examples

These examples illustrate how the pasimple library can be used. Ideally, they should be self-explanatory, show different use cases and run without installing further dependencies.

## Development notes

The examples can be run from the project root directory without building/installing the project, simply by running:
```sh
PYTHONPATH=".:$PYTHONPATH" examples/<example>.py
```
